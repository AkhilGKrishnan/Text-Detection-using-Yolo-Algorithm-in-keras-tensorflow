# Text-Detection-using-Yolo-Algorithm-in-keras-tensorflow

First step towards building an efficient OCR system is to find out the specific text locations. Implemented the YOLO ( You Only Look Once ) algorithm from scratch (no object detection API used) for the specific task of Scene Text Detection in python using keras and tensorflow.

## Data : 
The dataset is a subset of the ICDAR 2005 text locating competetion dataset.


Total images = 491 
Train images = 376
Validation images = 115
